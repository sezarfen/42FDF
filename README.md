Let's discover how to open a graphics window and draw inside !


Itâ€™s time for generating basic computer graphics project!

This project is about generating a simple wireframe model of a landscape.
## Subject and aim

You can change the projection version by your desire !

## Some sample pictures from project

## Don't forget to compile with thoose libraries

 - [libft (include get_next_line)](https://github.com/sezarfen/42Libft)
 - [ft_printf](https://github.com/sezarfen/42ft_printf)
 - [minilibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux)

## UPDATE!, now you can clone and start to use it directly in Linux (linux keycodes are used to navigate map)
